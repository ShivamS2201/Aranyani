Hydroponics is an interesting subject and We should try to gain more knowledge about the new techniques of harvesting possibilies in new avenues.
- Doesnot Have a backend.
- To be bulit <u>(Priority wise)</u>:
        
        - 3 sections explaining features of Hydroponics (Must be visulaly pleasing)
            | Using mainly Boostrap rows and cols  |
        - a contact us form and connect with necc. eamil.
        - Footer to be linked to necessary links / may be later.

An important feature used here in 1<sup>st</sup> section using Ul/Li to build a kind of coursel rather than usin boostrap functionality.
